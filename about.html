    <br>
    <p>What began in 1950 as Central Christian College (with an enrollment of 97) has grown into a comprehensive
        Christian university serving 2,200 students. Affiliated with the churches of Christ, Oklahoma Christian welcomes
        all students who respect the university's commitment to academic and spiritual excellence and who respect the
        academic and spiritual pursuits of their fellow students..<a href="#" style="font-family: monospace;">History &

    <h2>Mascot & Colors</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Oklahoma Christian University's “Eagles” athletic mascot originated in 1952-53, two years after the founding of
        the school as a junior college. Isaiah 40:31 has served as a theme verse through the years: “Those who hope in
        the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they
        will walk and not be faint.” Young and old fans alike enjoy seeing “Ike” the Eagle in costume at campus sporting
        events. OC's official colors of maroon and silver gray were selected by vote of the student body.
